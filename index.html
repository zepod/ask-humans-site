            <h1>Here is where you decide what should this app be about.
                Aim with witt. Good question can the positively affect many humans.
            </h1>
            <p>
                Questions can be about <strong>beliefs, experiences, desires, intentions</strong> and last (and least) <strong>opinions.</strong>
                In that order. Descending in the level of transcendence and substance. Beware of <strong>opinions</strong>, they are usually borrowed and shallow.
                Opinions is nonsense where nonsense likes to live.
            </p>
            <h3>Incomplete Answer list</h3>
            <div class="small">
                While 5 options ain't plenty, make an effort to include all possible answers, that are mutually exclusive.
                Use the trick of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a> to create broader or narrower
                categories, if you need to.
            </div>
            <h3>Non-universality</h3>
            <div class="small">
                When human answers <strong>None of the Above</strong>, your question will show up slightly less often
                for others.
                The same goes for <strong>Skipped</strong> questions with more significant effect.
                Make your questions answerable for everyone to collect many answers.
            </div>
            <h3>Presumptions</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Like <i>How fast can your rogalo fly?</i>, which presumes I own a rogalo in the first place. Watch out,
                humans tend to spin this pirouette quite often.
            </div>
            <h3>Objective Questions</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Or rather, questions probing for objective truth.
                Like: <i>How far is the moon</i> where you'd actually get a result telling you <i>How many people are
                willing to use Google for this question?</i>
            </div>
            <h3>Like literally</h3>
            <div class="small">Beware of your wording, humans can take words literally literally.</div>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px">
                <i>You can delete created question by swiping the question left, in Your Q&As section. However, you can delete
                only questions younger than 6 hours</i>

            <p>
                Each question you answer or create is stored in "Your Q&As" section. It's these questions
                you'll be able to use in <a href="#relating">Correlations</a>. Few things to know regarding answering:

            <h3>Skipping</h3>
            <div class="small">
                You can skip any question. Skipping will prevent that question from ever showing up for you again.
                Also you won't see the results.
            </div>
            <h3>Sample Size</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Beware of drawing conclusions from charts where only few answered. Always check the total number of answers
                at the bottom of the screen. The bigger the sample size, the more accurate the data.

                If you're feeling an unspoken unease about frivolous disclosure of your data, which is the cornerstone of this app, great!
                Internet has a long history of rogue databases, matrix-like farming of humans and other "mistakes". That's why this App, and it's author,
                are dedicated to "No Data Stealing" initiative.
            </h1>
            <p>

            <h3>Zero Leak</h3>
            <div class="small">
                No personal data leaves your device. It is not read, not collected, not stored. All data is inherently anonymous.
            </div>
            <h3>No Matrix-like human farming</h3>
            <div class="small">
                The data you provide is not to be exclusively disclosed to any 3rd party. If data is shared (with scientists), it is
                done publicly for the benefit of everyone.
            </div>
            <h3>No Espionage</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Your activity in the app is not being monitored, tracked or otherwise recorded.
                All you provide are questions and answers, nothing else.
            </div>
            <h3>Single-Key Identity</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Each human generates a random key. This key will be encrypted used to sign any data you provide.
                Only you know what is your key, only you know what data is yours.

            <h1 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 5rem">Transferring Identity to a different device</h1>
            <p>
                It's important to note, that your Key is stored the app's storage on your device. If you uninstall the app you lose the key.
                If you lose the, nobody will be able to associate you with your data (not the author, not even you). That's why you need
                request a temporary 1-day-expiry key in your app and then type it into a different instance of "Ask the Humans" app.
                Then your permanent key will be recovered and with it the contents of <strong>Your Q&As</strong> section.

                    Every now and then, I get into a this overwhelming, creative, cheeky, awe-full yet playful state of mind.
                    When a thought kidnaps my body for several days.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I came to an understanding that these  strange and wonderful entities, or thoughts if you want,
                    are like lightnings searching for nearby conduits. And that I can be nothing but a well behaved lighting rod,
                    which lights a city, instead of burning it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is the product of such an encounter and I am grateful that I can share it with you.
