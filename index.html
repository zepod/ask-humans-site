            <h1>This is where you decide what should this app be about.
                Aim with witt. Good question can the lift spirit of many humans.
            </h1>
            <p>
                Questions can be about <strong>beliefs, experiences, desires, intentions</strong> and both last and least <strong>opinions.</strong>
                In that order, descending in the level of transcendence. Beware of <strong>opinions</strong> they are borrowed and shallow, also
                known as the home of nonsense.
            </p>
            <h3>Incomplete Answer list</h3>
            <div class="small">
                While 5 options ain't plenty, make an effort to include all possible answers.
                Use the trick of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a> to create broader
                categories, if you need to.
            </div>
            <h3>Non-universality</h3>
            <div class="small">
                When human answers <strong>None of the Above</strong>, your question will show up slightly less often
                for others.
                The same goes for <strong>Skipped</strong> questions with more significant effect.
                Make your questions answerable for everyone to collect many answers.
            </div>
            <h3>Presumptions</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Like <i>How fast can your rogalo fly?</i>, which presumes I own a rogalo in the first place. Watch out,
                humans tend to spin this pirouette quite often.
            </div>
            <h3>Objective Questions</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Or rather, questions probing for objective truth.
                Like: <i>How far is the moon</i> where you'd actually get a result telling you <i>How many people are
                willing to use Google for a question?</i>
            </div>
            <h3>Like literally</h3>
            <div class="small">Beware of your wording, humans can take words literally literally.</div>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px">
                <i>You can delete created question by swiping the question left, in Your Q&As section. However, you can delete
                only questions younger than 6 hours</i>
            </p>

                Like a intellectual archeology! What if archeologists could just ask the people of that time?

            <p>
                Each question you answer or create is stored in "Your Q&As" section. It's these questions
                you'll be able to use in <a href="#relating">Correlations</a>. Few things to know regarding answering:
            </p>
            <h3>Skipping</h3>
            <div class="small">
                You can skip any question. Skipping will prevent a question from ever appearing for you again.
                Also you won't see the results.
            </div>
            <h3>Sample Size</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Beware of drawing conclusions from charts where only few answered. Always check the total number of answers
                at the bottom of the screen. The bigger the sample size, the more accurate the data.
