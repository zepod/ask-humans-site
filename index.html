            <h1>
                The world we live in isn't as much a product of our measurements (answers), as shallow science could propose.
                Science is only as good as the underlying Philosophy (PhD - Doctor of Philosophy). So what is our lived world
                about? In philosophy, a question is the basic unit, a container of axioms, the index of knowledge.
            </h1>
            <h1>
                Just like the archetype of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn">Jinn</a>, who gives you only
                <strong>exactly</strong> what you ask for, leaving you in some kind of self-induced painship.
            </h1>
            <p>
                Beware, that a question is a powerful spell. A spell that triggers a pattern-search algorithm in the brain
                of whoever hears this spell. In fact, you alter the future of the hearer, as by asking a question you
                construct a potential "answer object" in their future. In programming, these are called "futures", "promises"
                or "callbacks".
            </p>
            <p>
                In these definition, the world of only composed of two kinds of spell-casters. Those who realize they're wizards
                and those who don't.
            </p>
            <p>
                Questions can be about <strong>beliefs, experiences, desires, intentions</strong> and last (and least) <strong>opinions.</strong>
                In that order. Descending in the level of transcendence and substance. Beware of <strong>opinions</strong>, they are usually borrowed and shallow.
                Opinion is where nonsense likes to live.
            </p>
            <h3>Incomplete Answer list</h3>
            <div class="small">
                While 5 options ain't plenty, make an effort to include all possible answers, that are mutually exclusive.
                Use the trick of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a> to create broader or narrower
                categories, if you need to.
            </div>
            <h3>Non-universality</h3>
            <div class="small">
                When human answers <strong>None of the Above</strong>, your question will show up slightly less often
                for others.
                The same goes for <strong>Skipped</strong> questions with more significant effect.
                Make your questions answerable for everyone to collect many answers.
            </div>
            <h3>Presumptions</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Like <i>How fast can your rogalo fly?</i>, which presumes I own a rogalo in the first place. Watch out,
                humans tend to spin this pirouette quite often.
            </div>
            <h3>Objective Questions</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Or rather, questions probing for objective truth.
                Like: <i>How far is the moon</i> where you'd actually get a result telling you <i>How many people are
                willing to use Google for this question?</i>
            </div>
            <h3>Like literally</h3>
            <div class="small">Beware of your wording, humans can take words literally literally.</div>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px">
                <i>You can delete created question by swiping the question left, in Your Q&As section. However, you can delete
                only questions younger than 6 hours</i>

            <p>
                Each question you answer or create is stored in "Your Q&As" section. It's these questions
                you'll be able to use in <a href="#relating">Correlations</a>. Few things to know regarding answering:

            <h3>Skipping</h3>
            <div class="small">
                You can skip any question. Skipping will remove the question from the key, but it may reappear later.
                When you skip you won't see the results.
            </div>
            <h3>Sample Size</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Beware of drawing conclusions from charts where only few answered. Always check the total number of answers
                at the bottom of the screen. The bigger the sample size, the more accurate the data.

                Another important consideration is that people on "Ask the Humans" aren't random part of the population.
                At the very least we ask only those people who use mobile apps. That already introduces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias">bias</a>
                towards technophobic part of our communities. It's therefore important to contextualize each chart to
                the notion of who are people in the "Ask the Humans community". <a href="#relating">Correlations</a> is a good
                tool for this.

            <p>
                Start by selecting two questions to relate. It can be any question from Your Q&As section.
                Read as like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p class="not-fact">"Most people that are afraid of heights grew up in the city."</p></li>

                            I believe that making some high-end paid is a <strong>honest money model</strong>,
                            as it gives immediate value to You, while gives me the incentive to grow this app further.

            <h1>
                If you're feeling an unspoken unease about frivolous disclosure of your data, which is the cornerstone of this app, great!
                Internet has a long history of rogue databases, matrix-like farming of humans and other "mistakes". That's why this App, and it's author,
                are dedicated to "No Data Stealing" initiative.
            </h1>
            <h3>Inherently anonymous data</h3>
            <div class="small">
                No personal data leaves your device. It is not read, not collected, not stored. All data is inherently anonymous.
            </div>
            <h3>Data isn't a commodity</h3>
            <div class="small">
                The data you provide is not to be exclusively disclosed to any 3rd party. If data is shared (with scientists), it is
                done publicly for the benefit of everyone.
            </div>
            <h3>No stalking</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Your activity in the app is not being monitored, tracked or otherwise recorded.
                All you provide are questions and answers, nothing else.
            </div>
            <h3>VPN recommended</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Every action on the internet has your IP on it. This IP can be mapped to your location. While this app doesn't
                collect this information, you should trust no one. Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a>
                will hide your true IP from the internet, so you don't need to rely on good hearts of programmers. Use VPN, please.
            </div>
            <h3>Single-Key identity</h3>
            <div class="small">
                Each human generates a random key. This key will be encrypted used to sign any data you provide.
                Only you know what is your key, only you know what data is yours.
            </div>
            <div class="important-note">
                <h1>Transferring Identity to a different device</h1>
                <div class="important-note-content">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            It's important to note, that your Key is stored the app's storage on your device. If you uninstall the app you lose the key.
                            If you lose the, nobody will be able to associate you with your data (not the author, not even you).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's why you need request a temporary 1-day-expiry key in your app and then type it into a different instance of "Ask the Humans" app.
                            Then your permanent key will be recovered and with it the contents of <strong>Your Q&As</strong> section.

                    Every now and then, I get into a this overwhelming, creative, cheeky, awe-full, playful state of mind.
                    When a thought kidnaps my body for several days.
                </h1>
                <h1>
                    I came to an understanding that these  strange and wonderful entities, or thoughts if you want,
                    are like lightnings searching for nearby conduits. And that I can be nothing but a well behaved lighting rod,
                    which lights a city, instead of burning it.
